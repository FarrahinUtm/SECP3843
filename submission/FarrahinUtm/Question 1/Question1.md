# Special Topic Data Engineering (SECP3843): Alternative Assessment

#### Name: NURFARRAHIN BINTI CHE ALIAS
#### Matric No.: A20EC0121
#### Dataset: Mflix

## Question 1 (a)
You have been assigned the task of providing instructions to the technical staff on implementing a configuration using five servers used in this project. This task is to ensure seamless integration between the Django web framework, a JSON dataset provided in this project, and the MySQL and MongoDB databases. This integration will enable the creation of dynamic web pages for the portal. To successfully accomplish this, please provide a comprehensive explanation of the steps required to integrate Django with the JSON dataset, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval from both MySQL and MongoDB databases.

there will be  five server used for this project:

1. Web Server

2. Django  

3. MySQL Database

4. JSON Dataset 

5. MongoDB Database

   **SET UP DJANGO INSTALLATION**

   (please make sure that you have python installed in your computer)

   Install the environment needed in the command prompt
    ```
   py -m venv env
   ```
    ```
    env\Scripts\activate
     ```

  <img height="200px" src="submission/FarrahinUtm/materials/Screenshot (248).png"></img>
   
   Open Command Prompt/ terminal and type this command
   
   ```
   pip install Django
   ```

**SET UP DJANGO AppliATION**

  A Django app's default folder structure is generated by the startapp command. CREATE APP NAMED AA :

  
   ```
  python manage.py startapp AA
   ```
**MANAGE DATABASE**

To configure the database connections, open the settings.py file in your project folder in Visual Studio Code.

   ```
DATABASES = {
         'default': {
             'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
             'NAME': 'Mflix',
             'USER': 'root',
             'PASSWORD': '',
             'HOST': 'localhost',
             'PORT': 3306,
         },
         'mongodb': {
             'ENGINE': 'djongo',
             'ENFORCE_SCHEMA': False,
             'NAME': 'Mflix',
             'CLIENT': {
                 'host': 'localhost:27017',
                 'port': 27017,
                 'username': '',
                 'password': '',
             }
         }
     }
   ```

   **Construct Django Model**

   For your app's models.py file, add a new model to provide the attributes and structure of the JSON dataset. Use the built-in field types provided by Django, such as CharField and IntegerField, to construct model fields that correspond to the attributes of the JSON dataset.

  Enter the'models.py' file and specify the models that reflect the data and correspond to the JSON dataset's structure.
   ```
    python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
   


## Question 1 (b)
Design a detailed and comprehensive system architecture. Focusing on the seamless integration between the web server (Django), dataset (JSON), and databases (MySQL and MongoDB). Give detailed explanations for each component, utilizing precise terminology and suggesting acceptable terms to describe your understanding of the scenario.

We will concentrate on achieving seamless integration between the web server, dataset, and databases in the system architecture. Django will act as the web server in this architecture, and MySQL and MongoDB will function as the databases. The dataset will be in JSON format. Here is a thorough breakdown of each element:

1.Django-based web server

Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is used by the high-level Python web framework Django.

2.Sets of data (JSON)

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, simple-to-understand data exchange format.

3.(MySQL and MongoDB) databases:

A well-known relational database management system (RDBMS) with open-source code is MySQL, which stores structured data in tables with preset schemas.

MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that stores data in adaptable, self-descriptive documents that resemble JSON.

It is suited for managing unstructured or rapidly changing data due to its great performance, scalability, and adaptability.
